# Current task
- music and sound effects

# Next tasks
- the tetro flash thing
- add all required screens (splash, music type, game, game over, thx)
> tweak timing and juice
   - bonus on 4x lines removes + blip
   - finish gui mockup (borders, underlines, etc)
   - parameterize game design and events to all 3 stats
   - pause
- pause mode

# Usage & Interface

   > Convert samples

   > Music
   audio_mixer_music_queue(am, AMWID_MUSIC, loop?, override?) // To single channel ! Override ?
   audio_mixer_music_play(am) // sets music to playing
   audio_mixer_music_pause(am) // sets music to paused
   audio_mixer_music_stop(am) // stop and clear that music
   audio_mixer_music_volume(am, volume) // set volume

   > SFX
   audio_mixer_sfx_queue(am, AMWID_SFX) // To any free slot
   audio_mixer_sfx_play(am) // Play all music - Shared !?
   audio_mixer_sfx_pause(am) // Pause all sfx - Shared !?
   audio_mixer_sfx_stop(am) // Stop all sfx - Clear from slots
   audio_mixer_sfx_volume(am, volume) // set volume

   > Cleanup
   audio_mixer_destroy(am)

# Architecture

   > Setting up audio chain
   open default playback device with floating


   > Loading audio

   > Converting audio

   > Mixing audio in callback

   > Assumptions
      - Want floating point device may fail ? So convert audio samples to float, and then convert mixed result to the playback device format ?

# Audio stuff
- mixing audio samples
- caching loaded sounds into the same format (SDL_ConvertAudioSamples)
  or using audio streams directly !
- delta audio putting when more time passed than data given ?
- mutex for threaded locking 

# Bugs to fix
- multi-firing of input
- render I tetro properly
- flicker rendering tetro on first spawn (rendering related)

# Testing
- movement and rotation collision against play field and borders

# Improvement
- DT-based frame rendering interpolation
> limit framerate when VSync disabled
   - https://lazyfoo.net/tutorials/SDL3/12-frame-rate-and-vsync/index.php
> debug VS release build
   - process terminal
   - logging
