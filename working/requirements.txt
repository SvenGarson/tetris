# Next Task
- text tinting in engine
- game over text
- underlined text_ line and dotted
- timestep accumulated FDT interpolation + where to determine input state -> Currently double firing input states across ticks
- test rotation masks, placing, collision etc.
- render I tetro correctly based on rotation

# Testing
- movement collision of all types
- movement rotations of all types

# Gameplay Notes
> screens
   - splash
   - music type
   - game
   - death -> slash ?
> GUI
   - borders
   - field
   - score
   - level
   - lines
   - next shape
> tetro
   - rotations
   - blocking impossible rotations
   - support all tetro types
   - random type spawning in level based on seed
   - render tetros properly
   - movement left and right + input timing
   - movement jolt down with + input timing
   - full line break + flash + drop down
> juice
   - music
   - sfx

# Things to improve
- input lag and multiple fires
- adding source files, libraries, and linking to existing build process
- disable terminal running on release build
- timed rendering i.e. adding to batch for a certain time
- config flag for debug output

# Things to learn
- fynamic multi-dimensional arrays in C
