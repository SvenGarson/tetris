- volume controls
- get rid of dev exit and stuff like that
- debug config for errors ?
- decorations, final placement, more sprites + backgrounds (every screen !)

# Bugs to fix
- render I tetro properly
- flicker rendering tetro on first spawn (rendering related)

# Testing
- movement and rotation collision against play field and borders

# Improvement
- DT-based frame rendering interpolation
> limit framerate when VSync disabled
   - https://lazyfoo.net/tutorials/SDL3/12-frame-rate-and-vsync/index.php
> debug VS release build
   - process terminal
   - logging
> Better audio mixing and more robust device / stream conversion between input data and final form

# Things to learn
- dynamic multi-dimensional arrays in C
